        <div class="regPic"><span class="picleft"><img src="images/RCCWEFest.jpg" width="275" height="206" alt="RCC Wind Ensemble Festival" /></span></div>
        <p>On-location recording in its most basic form with Mantz Music involves two mics out in front of the ensemble capturing a stereo image of the perfomance. The two-track method is ideal for large acoustic ensembles such as wind ensembles and orchestras. This service starts at $200 for a single concert recording and includes editing and mastering. Additional spot-mics and full multi-track location recording is available up to 16 inputs when more control or flexibility of the sound is desired.</p>
