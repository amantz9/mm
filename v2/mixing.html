            <p><span class="emphasis">Free yourself from hourly studio charges for mixing!</span> Have your songs mixed by professional mix engineer Anthony Mantz without ever having to get in your car. The process is simple. First fill out the online mixing quote form. Next you will receive an email with links where you can upload your audio files and make payments. Then I will mix your project and send it back to you for approval. Once you are happy with any revisions, that's it. You now have a mix ready for mastering. Take comfort in knowing that your mix is not finished until you say it is finished. Mantz Music offers unlimited mix revisions because you should not be charged extra to make something right.</p>

    	<h3>Preparing Your Session for Mixdown</h3>
        <p>Please prepare your session using the following steps, otherwise I will not be able to start mixing your project until you have done so:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Make sure all files are .wav or .aif. Any MIDI files must be bounced/rendered as audio files to be accepted.</li>
            <li>Make sure all files start at 0:00:00 on the time line and run continuously to the end of the part.</li>
            <li>Make sure all audio files have meaningful names such as kick or ohleft or BGV1. Files names such as audio1.wav and audio2.wav have no meaning and will seriously slow down the process so I can figure out what is what.
            <li>Make sure the arrangement is the way you want it on the finished project. Although I am perfectly capable of rearranging the parts, that is production, not mixing. If you would like me to provide production services, just let me know and I will give you a quote.</li>
            <li>Dry audio files (no effects) are highly recommended to allow more flexibility with effects. Remember there is no way to remove an effect once it has been printed to the track. For that reason, send a wet and dry version of any "must have" effects.</li>
        </ul>
    	<h3>Add-On Options</h3>
        <p>Each of the following options are for additional versions of your mixes based on the final version of your main mix.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Mastering
            	<ul><li>While mastering is generally reserved for a mastering engineer with specialized mastering equipment for high budget projects, I can provide mastering services to those who are not planning on sending the mixes to a mastering studio. Mastering is probably the most misunderstood part of the recording process. In a nutshell this is when the final two-track mixes are sequenced in a way that the album makes sense musically, balanced from one song to the next, polished with eq and other subtle effects, and finally brought up to industry standard playback levels.</li>
                <li>With this add-on you will receive your final mix(es) and a mastered version of your project so you can compare what the difference is. If you want to try mastering on only one song that is fine so you can determine if I am the right person for the job. You can always have me master the rest after the fact.</li>
                <li>Mastering is also available if you had your project mixed somewhere else. Just click on "Mastering Only" on the quote form if you want me to master previously mixed tracks.</li>
                </ul>
           	</li>
            <li>Vocal-Up
            	<ul><li>Identical to the main mix, except the lead vocal is raised 1 to 3 db</li></ul>
           	</li>
            <li>Vocal-Down
            	<ul><li>Identical to the main mix, except the lead vocal is lowered 1 to 3 db</li></ul>
          	</li>
            <li>Acapella
            	<ul><li>Vocal-only mix including lead and background vocals.</li></ul>
           	</li>
            <li>Music Only
            	<ul><li>Main mix without any of the vocals.</li></ul>
           	</li>
            <li>Stems
            	<ul><li>Instrument groups are broken down into stereo pairs such as drums, guitars, background vocals, etc. A click stem can also be added if you will be using this as a backup track for live performance.</li></ul>
           	</li>
            <li>Clean Version
            	<ul><li>Identical to main mix execpt "explicit lyrics" are removed to make the song acceptable for radio airplay.</li></ul>
           	</li>
            <li>Custom
            	<ul><li>Any requested combination of mix elements. This is useful if you are a solo artist using the mix as a backup track for live performance. You can select what instruments you need to fill out your sound.</li></ul>
           	</li>
